- Mahmoud Diab: Miss understanding the flow of fetching data from our APIs and connect between client-server sides. 
- Hadi: Explain the basics slowly, and we need to deeply understand the things we use.
- May+Khaled: We did some researchs and we find a lot of resources/materials that  not related to our project needs.
